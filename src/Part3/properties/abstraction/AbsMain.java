    * so I just write the ArrayList list = new ArrayList(); and the use the list
    * I also do somethings like the list.add() so these are all the things that are predefined into the class showing what I want to use and what is hidden behind
    * this is called abstraction
    * so that the whole thing used into the abstraction is called the abstract variables (ArrayList)
    * Abstraction works upon the external stuff */
