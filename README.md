# 🎓 OOP in Java - Learning Repository

> **A learning phase repository** for mastering Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java. This repo will be updated continuously as new topics are learned and explored.

## 📚 About

This repository documents my journey learning Object-Oriented Programming in Java through hands-on examples and practice. Each topic is organized in focused modules with clear, well-commented code that prioritizes learning and understanding.

## ✨ Topics Covered

- **Object Basics**
  - Object creation and property access
  - Reference variables
  - Using `this` keyword

- **Constructors**
  - No-arg constructors
  - Parameterized constructors
  - Copy constructors
  - Constructor chaining

- **Static & Non-Static**
  - Static fields and methods
  - Static vs instance members
  - Static initialization blocks
  - Static inner classes vs non-static inner classes

- **Design Patterns**
  - Singleton pattern

- **Inheritance**
  - Class inheritance using `extends`
  - Using `super` keyword
  - Parent-child class relationships

- **Packages & Imports**
  - Package organization
  - Static imports

## 📂 Repository Structure

```
src/
├── Part1/          # Object fundamentals, constructors, and this keyword
├── Part2/          # Static/non-static concepts, singleton pattern, packages
└── Part3/          # Inheritance and class relationships
```

## 🚀 How to Run

Run examples in your favorite Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, Eclipse):

1. Open any Java file
2. Ensure the `main` method has the standard signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`
3. Run the file to see the concept in action

**Command Line:**
```bash
javac -d out $(find src -name "*.java")
java -cp out Part1.Main
```

## 🔄 Status

This repository is actively maintained and will be updated as I learn new OOP concepts. Topics like encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, interfaces, and more advanced design patterns will be added in future updates.
